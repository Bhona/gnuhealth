	<field name="description">A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins.</field>

	<field name="description">A non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by impaired night vision. Congenital stationary night blindness type 1B is an autosomal recessive form associated with a negative electroretinogram waveform. Patients are night blind from an early age, and when maximally dark-adapted, they could perceive lights only with an intensity equal to or slightly dimmer than that normally detected by the cone system. ERGs in response to single brief flashes of light have clearly detectable a-waves, which are derived from photoreceptors, and greatly reduced b-waves, which are derived from the second-order inner retinal neurons. ERGs in response to sawtooth flickering light indicate a markedly reduced on response and a nearly normal OFF response. There is no subjective delay in the perception of suddenly appearing white vs black objects on a gray background.</field>

Typically, symptoms develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. 'Torsion' refers to the twisting nature of body movements observed in DYT1, often affecting the trunk. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals, ranging from mild focal dystonia to severe generalized dystonia, even within families.</field>

Paroxysmal dyskinesias are neurological disorders characterized by sudden, unpredictable, disabling attacks of involuntary movement often requiring life-long treatment. The coexistence of epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia in the same individual or family is an increasingly recognized phenomenon. Patients manifest absence seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, involuntary dystonic or choreiform movements. Onset is usually in childhood and patients may have seizures only, dyskinesia only, or both.</field>

It is characterized biochemically by excessive excretion of acetate-substituted porphyrins and accumulation of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase levels are very low in erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts.</field>

They are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on whether the enzyme deficiency occurs in red blood cells or in the liver. Hereditary coproporphyria is an acute hepatic porphyria characterized by skin photosensitivity, attacks of abdominal pain, neurological disturbances, and psychiatric symptoms. Most attacks are precipitated by drugs, alcohol, caloric deprivation, infections, or endocrine factors. Hereditary coproporphyria is biochemically characterized by overexcretion of coproporphyrin III in the urine and in the feces.</field>

The neurological phenotype is often complicated by severe infections, osteomyelitis, and amputations. HSAN1A is an autosomal dominant axonal form with onset in the second or third decades. Initial symptoms are loss of pain, touch, heat, and cold sensation over the feet, followed by distal muscle wasting and weakness. Loss of pain sensation leads to chronic skin ulcers and distal amputations.</field>

	<field name="description">A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).</field>

Inter- and intrafamilial variability is very wide, such that patients with hydrocephalus, MASA, SPG1, and agenesis of corpus callosum can be present within the same family.</field>

	<field name="acronym">MYOSCN4A</field>
	<field name="description">A phenotypically highly variable myotonia aggravated by potassium loading, and sometimes by cold. Myotonia is characterized by sustained muscle tensing that prevents muscles from relaxing normally. It causes muscle stiffness that can interfere with movement. In some people the stiffness is very mild, while in other cases it may be severe enough to interfere with walking, running, and other activities of daily life. Myotonia SCN4A-related includes myotonia permanens and myotonia fluctuans. In myotonia permanens, the myotonia is generalized and there is a hypertrophy of the muscle, particularly in the neck and the shoulder. Attacks of severe muscle stiffness of the thoracic muscles may be life threatening due to impaired ventilation. In myotonia fluctuans, the muscle stiffness may fluctuate from day to day, provoked by exercise.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural deafness results from damage to the neural receptors of the inner ear, the nerve pathways to the brain, or the area of the brain that receives sound information. DFNA6 is a low-frequency hearing loss in which frequencies of 2000 Hz and below are predominantly affected. Many patients have tinnitus, but there are otherwise no associated features such as vertigo. Because high-frequency hearing is generally preserved, patients retain excellent understanding of speech, although presbycusis or noise exposure may cause high-frequency loss later in life. DFNA6 worsens over time without progressing to profound deafness.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of non-syndromic hearing loss characterized by onset in the fourth or fifth decade of life and initially involves the high frequencies. Hearing loss is progressive and usually complete by the sixth decade. In addition to cochlear involvement, DFNA9 patients also exhibit a spectrum of vestibular dysfunctions. Penetrance of the vestibular symptoms is often incomplete, and some patients are minimally affected, whereas others suffer from severe balance disturbances and episodes of vertigo. Affected individuals have mucopolysaccharide depositions in the channels of the cochlear and vestibular nerves. These depositions apparently cause strangulation and degeneration of dendritic fibers.</field>

	<field name="acronym">OPTA1</field>
	<field name="description">A rare genetic disease characterized by abnormally dense bone, due to defective resorption of immature bone. Osteopetrosis occurs in two forms: a severe autosomal recessive form occurring in utero, infancy, or childhood, and a benign autosomal dominant form occurring in adolescence or adulthood. OPTA1 is an autosomal dominant form characterized by generalized osteosclerosis most pronounced in the cranial vault. Patients are often asymptomatic, but some suffer from pain and hearing loss. It appears to be the only type of osteopetrosis not associated with an increased fracture rate.</field>

	<field name="description">A severe form of polycystic kidney disease affecting the kidneys and the hepatic biliary tract. The clinical spectrum is widely variable, with most cases presenting during infancy. The fetal phenotypic features classically include enlarged and echogenic kidneys, as well as oligohydramnios secondary to a poor urine output. Up to 50% of the affected neonates die shortly after birth, as a result of severe pulmonary hypoplasia and secondary respiratory insufficiency. In the subset that survives the perinatal period, morbidity and mortality are mainly related to severe systemic hypertension, renal insufficiency, and portal hypertension due to portal-tract fibrosis.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of porphyria. Porphyrias are inherited defects in the biosynthesis of heme, resulting in the accumulation and increased excretion of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors. They are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on whether the enzyme deficiency occurs in red blood cells or in the liver. Variegate porphyria is the most common form of porphyria in South Africa. It is characterized by skin hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis, abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypertension and neuromuscular disturbances. High fecal levels of protoporphyrin and coproporphyrin, increased urine uroporphyrins and iron overload are typical markers of the disease.</field>

EPM2 occurs worldwide, but it is particularly common in the mediterranean countries of southern Europe and northern Africa, in southern India and in the Middle East. At the cellular level, it is characterized by accumulation of starch-like polyglucosans called Lafora bodies (LBs) that are most abundant in organs with the highest glucose metabolism: brain, heart, liver and skeletal muscle. Among other conditions involving polyglucosans, EPM2 is unique in that the inclusions are in neuronal dendrites but not axons and the forming polyglucosan fibrils are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.</field>

Spinal muscular atrophy refers to a group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. SMAX1 occurs only in men. Age at onset is usually in the third to fifth decade of life, but earlier involvement has been reported. It is characterized by slowly progressive limb and bulbar muscle weakness with fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and gynecomastia. The disorder is clinically similar to classic forms of autosomal spinal muscular atrophy.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of spinal muscular atrophy, a group of neuromuscular disorder characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Autosomal recessive forms are classified according to the age of onset, the maximum muscular activity achieved, and survivorship. The severity of the disease is mainly determined by the copy number of SMN2, a copy gene which predominantly produces exon 7-skipped transcripts and only low amount of full-length transcripts that encode for a protein identical to SMN1. Only about 4% of SMA patients bear one SMN1 copy with an intragenic mutation. SMA1 is a severe form, with onset before 6 months of age. SMA1 patients never achieve the ability to sit.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of alpha-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. The level of alpha chain production can range from none to very nearly normal levels. Deletion of both copies of each of the two alpha-globin genes causes alpha(0)-thalassemia, also known as homozygous alpha thalassemia. Due to the complete absence of alpha chains, the predominant fetal hemoglobin is a tetramer of gamma-chains (Bart hemoglobin) that has essentially no oxygen carrying capacity. This causes oxygen starvation in the fetal tissues leading to prenatal lethality or early neonatal death. The loss of two alpha genes results in mild alpha-thalassemia, also known as heterozygous alpha-thalassemia. Affected individuals have small red cells and a mild anemia (microcytosis). If three of the four alpha-globin genes are functional, individuals are completely asymptomatic. Some rare forms of alpha-thalassemia are due to point mutations (non-deletional alpha-thalassemia).</field>

The pathology of Parkinson disease involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies (intraneuronal accumulations of aggregated proteins), in surviving neurons in various areas of the brain. The disease is progressive and usually manifests after the age of 50 years, although early-onset cases (before 50 years) are known. The majority of the cases are sporadic suggesting a multifactorial etiology based on environmental and genetic factors. However, some patients present with a positive family history for the disease. Familial forms of the disease usually begin at earlier ages and are associated with atypical clinical features.</field>

Osteopetrosis occurs in two forms: a severe autosomal recessive form occurring in utero, infancy, or childhood, and a benign autosomal dominant form occurring in adolescence or adulthood. Recessive osteopetrosis commonly manifests in early infancy with macrocephaly, feeding difficulties, evolving blindness and deafness, bone marrow failure, severe anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Deafness and blindness are generally thought to represent effects of pressure on nerves. OPTB3 is associated with renal tubular acidosis, cerebral calcification (marble brain disease) and in some cases with mental retardation.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of beta-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. Absence of beta chain causes beta(0)-thalassemia, while reduced amounts of detectable beta globin causes beta(+)-thalassemia. In the severe forms of beta-thalassemia, the excess alpha globin chains accumulate in the developing erythroid precursors in the marrow. Their deposition leads to a vast increase in erythroid apoptosis that in turn causes ineffective erythropoiesis and severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. Clinically, beta-thalassemia is divided into thalassemia major which is transfusion dependent, thalassemia intermedia (of intermediate severity), and thalassemia minor that is asymptomatic.</field>

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT3 includes congenital cerulean and sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities, among others. Cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities is characterized by white opacification around the anterior and posterior Y sutures, and grayish and bluish, spindle shaped, oval punctate and cerulean opacities of various sizes arranged in lamellar form. The spots are more concentrated towards the peripheral layers and do not delineate the embryonal or fetal nucleus. Phenotypic variation with respect to the size and density of the sutural opacities as well as the number and position of punctate and cerulean spots is observed among affected subjects.</field>

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. In general, the more posteriorly located and dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function. CTRCT21 includes cerulean and pulverulent cataracts. Cerulean cataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye.</field>

An almost total lack of LCT activity is found in jejunal biopsy material of patients with congenital lactase deficiency. Opposite to congenital lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is caused by developmental down-regulation of lactase activity during childhood or early adulthood. The decline of lactase activity is a normal physiological phenomenon; however, the majority of Northern Europeans have the ability to maintain lactase activity and digest lactose throughout life (lactase persistence). The down-regulation of lactase activity operates at the transcriptional level and it is associated with a noncoding variation in the MCM6 gene, located in the upstream vicinity of LCT.</field>

Epidemiologic studies have failed to implicate the ingestion of infected animal meat in the pathogenesis of CJD in human. The triad of microscopic features that characterize the prion diseases consists of (1) spongiform degeneration of neurons, (2) severe astrocytic gliosis that often appears to be out of proportion to the degree of nerve cell loss, and (3) amyloid plaque formation. CJD is characterized by progressive dementia and myoclonic seizures, affecting adults in mid-life. Some patients present sleep disorders, abnormalities of high cortical function, cerebellar and corticospinal disturbances. The disease ends in death after a 3-12 months illness.</field>

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT4 includes crystalline aculeiform, congenital cerulean and non-nuclear polymorphic cataracts, among others. Crystalline aculeiform cataract is characterized by fiberglass-like or needle-like crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Non-nuclear polymorphic cataract is a partial opacity with variable location between the fetal nucleus of the lens and the equator. The fetal nucleus is normal. The opacities are irregular and look similar to a bunch of grapes and may be present simultaneously in different lens layers. Congenital cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract.</field>

	<field name="acronym">DD</field>
	<field name="description">A skin disorder characterized by warty papules and plaques in seborrheic areas (central trunk, flexures, scalp and forehead), palmoplantar pits and distinctive nail abnormalities. It is due to loss of adhesion between epidermal cells (acantholysis) and abnormal keratinization. Patients with mild disease may have no more than a few scattered keratotic papules or subtle nail changes, whereas those with severe disease are handicapped by widespread malodorous keratotic plaques. Some patients present with hemorrhage into acantholytic vesicles on the palms and dorsal aspects of the fingers which gives rise to black macules. In a few families affected by Darier disease, neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as mild mental retardation, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and epilepsy have been reported. Stress, UV exposure, heat, sweat, friction and oral contraception exacerbate disease symptoms. Clinical variants of Darier disease include hypertrophic, vesicobullous, hypopigmented, cornifying, zosteriform or linear, acute and comedonal subtypes. Comedonal Darier disease is characterized by the coexistence of acne-like comedonal lesions with typical Darier hyperkeratotic papules on light-exposed areas. At histopathologic level, comedonal Darier disease differs from classic Darier disease in the prominent follicular involvement and the presence of greatly elongated dermal villi.</field>

	<field name="description">Early-onset myopathies are inherited muscle disorders that manifest typically from birth or infancy with hypotonia, muscle weakness, and delayed motor development. EOMFC is a titinopathy that, in contrast with the previously described examples, involves both heart and skeletal muscle, has a congenital onset, and is purely recessive. This phenotype is due to homozygous out-of-frame TTN deletions, which lead to a total absence of titin's C-terminal end from striated muscles and to secondary CAPN3 depletion.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of sarcoidosis manifesting in children younger than 4 years of age. Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic, systemic, inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of immune granulomas in involved organs. Granulomas predominantly invade the lungs and the lymphatic system, but also skin, liver, spleen, eyes and other organs may be involved. Early-onset sarcoidosis is quite rare and has a distinct triad of skin, joint and eye disorders, without apparent pulmonary involvement. Compared with an asymptomatic and sometimes naturally disappearing course of the disease in older children, early-onset sarcoidosis is progressive and in many cases causes severe complications, such as blindness, joint destruction and visceral involvement.</field>

Individuals with symptomatic IGAD often have deficiency of IgG subclasses or decreased antibody response to carbohydrate antigens such as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Individuals with IGAD also suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections and have an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders and of lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. In vitro studies have suggested that some individuals with IGAD have impaired isotype class switching to IgA and others may have a post-switch defect. IGAD and CVID have been known to coexist in families. Some individuals initially present with IGAD1 and then develop CVID. These observations suggest that some cases of IGAD and CVID may have a common etiology.</field>

Osteoclastic overactivity followed by compensatory osteoblastic activity leads to a structurally disorganized mosaic of bone (woven bone), which is mechanically weaker, larger, less compact, more vascular, and more susceptible to fracture than normal adult lamellar bone. PDB5 clinical manifestations include short stature, progressive long bone deformities, fractures, vertebral collapse, skull enlargement, and hyperostosis with progressive deafness.</field>

	<field name="description">JP/HHT syndrome phenotype consists of the coexistence of juvenile polyposis (JIP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [MIM:187300] in a single individual. JIP and HHT are autosomal dominant disorders with distinct and non-overlapping clinical features. The former, an inherited gastrointestinal malignancy predisposition, is caused by mutations in SMAD4 or BMPR1A, and the latter is a vascular malformation disorder caused by mutations in ENG or ACVRL1. All four genes encode proteins involved in the transforming-growth-factor-signaling pathway. Although there are reports of patients and families with phenotypes of both disorders combined, the genetic etiology of this association is unknown.</field>

In general, the more posteriorly located and dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function. CTRCT23 is a zonular cataract. Zonular or lamellar cataracts are opacities, broad or narrow, usually consisting of powdery white dots affecting only certain layers or zones between the cortex and nucleus of an otherwise clear lens. The opacity may be so dense as to render the entire central region of the lens completely opaque, or so translucent that vision is hardly if at all impeded. Zonular cataracts generally do not involve the embryonic nucleus, though sometimes they involve the fetal nucleus. Usually sharply separated from a clear cortex outside them, they may have projections from their outer edges known as riders or spokes.</field>

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.</field>

Onset occurs in the first decade, usually between ages 5 and 9. Painful attacks with photophobia, foreign body sensations, and recurrent erosions occur in most patients. The disease is due to deposition of an unsulfated keratan sulfate both within the intracellular space (within the keratocytes and endothelial cells) and in the extracellular corneal stroma. Macular corneal dystrophy is divided into the clinically indistinguishable types I, IA, and II based on analysis of the normally sulfated, or antigenic, keratan sulfate levels in serum and immunohistochemical evaluation of the cornea. Patients with types I and IA macular corneal dystrophy have undetectable serum levels of antigenic keratan sulfate, whereas those with type II macular corneal dystrophy have normal or low levels, depending on the population examined.</field>

It is characterized by predisposition to illness caused by moderately virulent mycobacterial species, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and by the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. Clinical outcome severity depends on the degree of impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity. Some patients die of overwhelming mycobacterial disease with lepromatous-like lesions in early childhood, whereas others develop, later in life, disseminated but curable infections with tuberculoid granulomas.</field>

	<field name="acronym">NAIC</field>
	<field name="description">Severe autosomal recessive intrahepatic cholestasis, originally described in Ojibway-Cree children from northwestern Quebec. NAIC typically presents with transient neonatal jaundice, in a child who is otherwise healthy, and progresses to biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Biochemical and histopathological features suggest involvement of the bile ducts rather than of the bile canaliculi. They include elevated gamma glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, and, typically, marked fibrosis around bile ducts. Clinically, NAIC is distinct from other nonsyndromic familial cholestases because of its marked cholangiopathic features and severe degree of fibrosis on liver histology.</field>

Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is central to the modulation of cell shape and migration. FLNA is a widely expressed protein that regulates re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes and second messengers. Males with OPD1 have cleft palate, malformations of the ossicles causing deafness and milder bone and limb defects than those associated with OPD2. Obligate female carriers of mutations causing both OPD1 and OPD2 have variable (often milder) expression of a similar phenotypic spectrum.</field>

	<field name="acronym">NBIA1</field>
	<field name="description">Autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder associated with iron accumulation in the brain, primarily in the basal ganglia. Clinical manifestations include progressive muscle spasticity, hyperreflexia, muscle rigidity, dystonia, dysarthria, and intellectual deterioration which progresses to severe dementia over several years. It is clinically classified into classic, atypical, and intermediate phenotypes. Classic forms present with onset in first decade, rapid progression, loss of independent ambulation within 15 years. Atypical forms have onset in second decade, slow progression, maintenance of independent ambulation up to 40 years later. Intermediate forms manifest onset in first decade with slow progression or onset in second decade with rapid progression. Patients with early onset tend to also develop pigmentary retinopathy, whereas those with later onset tend to also have speech disorders and psychiatric features. All patients have the 'eye of the tiger' sign on brain MRI.</field>

The pathology of Parkinson disease involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies (intraneuronal accumulations of aggregated proteins), in surviving neurons in various areas of the brain. The disease is progressive and usually manifests after the age of 50 years, although early-onset cases (before 50 years) are known. The majority of the cases are sporadic suggesting a multifactorial etiology based on environmental and genetic factors. However, some patients present with a positive family history for the disease. Familial forms of the disease usually begin at earlier ages and are associated with atypical clinical features.</field>

	<field name="description">Platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasias (PLSDs) are a heterogeneous group of chondrodysplasias characterized by severe platyspondyly and limb shortening. PLSD-T is characterized by varying platyspondyly, short ribs with anterior cupping, hypoplasia of the lower ilia with broad ischial and pubic bones, and shortening of the tubular bones with splayed and cupped metaphyses. Histology of the growth plate typically shows focal hypercellularity with slightly enlarged chondrocytes in the resting cartilage and relatively well-preserved columnar formation and ossification at the chondro-osseous junction. PLSD-T is generally a perinatally lethal disease, but a few long-term survivors have been reported.</field>

The disease presents with recurrent episodes of acute muscular weakness of the four extremities that vary in severity from paresis to complete paralysis. Attacks are triggered by ingestion of a high carbohydrate load or strenuous physical activity followed by a period of rest. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis can occur in association with any cause of hyperthyroidism, but is most commonly associated with Graves disease.</field>

	<field name="acronym">CTRCT1</field>
	<field name="description">An opacification of the crystalline lens of the eye that frequently results in visual impairment or blindness. Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT1 includes congenital, zonular pulverulent, nuclear progressive, nuclear pulverulent, nuclear total, total, and posterior subcapsular types of cataract. Zonular or lamellar cataracts are opacities, broad or narrow, usually consisting of powdery white dots affecting only certain layers or zones between the cortex and nucleus of an otherwise clear lens. The opacity may be so dense as to render the entire central region of the lens completely opaque, or so translucent that vision is hardly if at all impeded. Zonular cataracts generally do not involve the embryonic nucleus, though sometimes they involve the fetal nucleus. Usually sharply separated from a clear cortex outside them, they may have projections from their outer edges known as riders or spokes. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye.</field>

	<field name="description">A congenital ocular motility disorder marked by restrictive ophthalmoplegia affecting extraocular muscles innervated by the oculomotor and/or trochlear nerves. It is clinically characterized by anchoring of the eyes in downward gaze, ptosis, and backward tilt of the head. Congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles type 3 presents as a non-progressive, autosomal dominant disorder with variable expression. Patients may be bilaterally or unilaterally affected, and their oculo-motility defects range from complete ophthalmoplegia (with the eyes fixed in a hypo- and exotropic position), to mild asymptomatic restrictions of ocular movement. Ptosis, refractive error, amblyopia, and compensatory head positions are associated with the more severe forms of the disorder. In some cases, the ocular phenotype is accompanied by additional features including developmental delay, corpus callosum agenesis, basal ganglia dysmorphism, facial weakness, polyneuropathy.</field>

	<field name="description">A complex, multifactorial psychotic disorder or group of disorders characterized by disturbances in the form and content of thought (e.g. delusions, hallucinations), in mood (e.g. inappropriate affect), in sense of self and relationship to the external world (e.g. loss of ego boundaries, withdrawal), and in behavior (e.g bizarre or apparently purposeless behavior). Although it affects emotions, it is distinguished from mood disorders in which such disturbances are primary. Similarly, there may be mild impairment of cognitive function, and it is distinguished from the dementias in which disturbed cognitive function is considered primary. Some patients manifest schizophrenic as well as bipolar disorder symptoms and are often given the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.</field>

It lacks malignant epithelial elements, a feature that distinguishes it from the classic adult-type pulmonary blastoma. It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor.</field>

	<field name="description">A genodermatosis characterized by poikiloderma, pachyonychia and chronic neutropenia. The disorder starts as a papular erythematous rash on the limbs during the first year of life. It gradually spreads centripetally and, as the papular rash resolves, hypo- and hyperpigmentation result, with development of telangiectasias. Another skin manifestation is pachyonychia, but alopecia and leukoplakia are distinctively absent. Patients have recurrent pneumonias that usually result in reactive airway disease and/or chronic cough. One of the most important extracutaneous symptoms is an increased susceptibility to infections, mainly affecting the respiratory system, primarily due to a chronic neutropenia and to neutrophil functional defects. Bone marrow abnormalities account for neutropenia and may evolve into myelodysplasia associated with the risk of leukemic transformation. Poikiloderma with neutropenia shows phenotypic overlap with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.</field>

This may lead to compensatory retinal neovascularization, which is thought to be induced by hypoxia from the initial avascular insult. New vessels are prone to leakage and rupture causing exudates and bleeding, followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Clinical features can be highly variable, even within the same family. Patients with mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic, and their only disease related abnormality is an arc of avascular retina in the extreme temporal periphery.</field>

	<field name="acronym">HNPCC8</field>
	<field name="description">An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected.</field>

	<field name="description">A rare neurologic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and a variety of cranial nerve palsies, which develop over a relatively short period of time in a previously healthy individual. Sensorineural hearing loss may precede the neurological signs. The course is invariably progressive, but the rate of decline is variable within and between families. With disease evolution, long tract signs, lower motor neuron signs, cerebellar ataxia and lower cranial nerve (III-VI) palsies develop, giving rise to a complex picture resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Diaphragmatic weakness and respiratory compromise are some of the most distressing features, leading to recurrent chest infections and respiratory failure, which are often the cause of patients' demise.</field>

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.</field>

	<field name="description">A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins.</field>

	<field name="description">A rare autosomal recessive form of systemic lupus erythematosus with childhood onset, characterized by high frequency of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and lupus nephritis. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, and often febrile multisystemic disorder of connective tissue, characterized principally by involvement of the skin, joints, kidneys and serosal membranes. It is of unknown etiology, but is thought to represent a failure of the regulatory mechanisms of the autoimmune system. The disease is marked by a wide range of system dysfunctions, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the formation of LE cells in the blood or bone marrow.</field>

It is a common condition, affecting 2-5% of children aged 3 months to 5 years. The majority are simple febrile seizures (generally defined as generalized onset, single seizures with a duration of less than 30 minutes). Complex febrile seizures are characterized by focal onset, duration greater than 30 minutes, and/or more than one seizure in a 24 hour period. The likelihood of developing epilepsy following simple febrile seizures is low. Complex febrile seizures are associated with a moderately increased incidence of epilepsy.</field>

Additional features are dysphagia resulting in poor feeding, failure to thrive, poor head control, facial weakness, cleft palate, contractures and scoliosis. Affected individuals become ventilator-dependent, and most require feeding by gastrostomy. The disorder results in severe muscle weakness and most patients never achieve walking. Death from respiratory failure in childhood occurs in about half of patients. Muscle biopsies from affected individuals show myopathic changes, replacement of myofibers with fatty tissue, small and incompletely fused muscle fibers, and variation in fiber size. Short regions of sarcomeric disorganization with few or no mitochondria (minicores) have been observed in some cases.</field>

Polydactyly is variably present. Non-skeletal involvement can include cleft lip/palate as well as anomalies of major organs such as the brain, eye, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, intestines, and genitalia. Some forms of the disease are lethal in the neonatal period due to respiratory insufficiency secondary to a severely restricted thoracic cage, whereas others are compatible with life. Disease spectrum encompasses Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome), Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, and short rib-polydactyly syndrome. SRTD9 is characterized by phalangeal cone-shaped epiphyses, chronic renal disease, nearly constant retinal dystrophy, and mild radiographic abnormality of the proximal femur. Occasional features include short stature, cerebellar ataxia, and hepatic fibrosis.</field>

The hypertrichosis leads to thick scalp hair, which extends onto the forehead, and a general increase in body hair. In addition, macrocephaly and coarse facial features, including a broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, a wide mouth, and full lips, can be suggestive of a storage disorder. About half of affected individuals are macrosomic and edematous at birth, whereas in childhood they usually have a muscular appearance with little subcutaneous fat. Thickened calvarium, narrow thorax, wide ribs, flattened or ovoid vertebral bodies, coxa valga, osteopenia, enlarged medullary canals, and metaphyseal widening of long bones have been reported. Cardiac manifestations such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusions are present in approximately 80% of cases. Motor development is usually delayed due to hypotonia. Most patients have a mild speech delay, and a small percentage have learning difficulties or intellectual disability.</field>

	<field name="description">A disorder characterized by distal muscular atrophy mainly affecting the upper extremities, in contrast to other distal motor neuronopathies. These constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular diseases caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN5B is characterized by onset in the first or second decade of distal muscle weakness and atrophy, primarily affecting the intrinsic hand muscles, but also affecting the lower legs, resulting in abnormal gait and pes cavus.</field>

	<field name="description">A recessive demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. CMT4F is characterized by distal sensory impairment and distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the lower more than the upper limbs. The age at onset is variable and can range from childhood to adult years. When the onset is in infancy, the phenotype is characterized as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome.</field>

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).</field>

	<field name="description">A rare genetic disease characterized by abnormally dense bone, due to defective resorption of immature bone. Osteopetrosis occurs in two forms: a severe autosomal recessive form occurring in utero, infancy, or childhood, and a benign autosomal dominant form occurring in adolescence or adulthood. Recessive osteopetrosis commonly manifests in early infancy with macrocephaly, feeding difficulties, evolving blindness and deafness, bone marrow failure, severe anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Deafness and blindness are generally thought to represent effects of pressure on nerves. OPTB8 is clinically characterized by dense bones with no distinction between outer and inner plates, due to extensive encroachment of cortical bone into the medullary space, increased head circumference, broad open fontanelle, frontal bossing, and hepatosplenomegaly. Osteoclasts number is low and their bone resorptive capacity is impaired.</field>

	<field name="acronym">HMN7A</field>
	<field name="description">A neuromuscular disorder. Distal hereditary motor neuronopathies constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN7A is characterized by onset in the second decade of progressive distal muscle wasting and weakness affecting the upper and lower limbs and resulting in walking difficulties and hand grip. There is significant muscle atrophy of the hands and lower limbs. The disorder is associated with vocal cord paresis due to involvement of the tenth cranial nerve.</field>

	<field name="acronym">MSUDMV</field>
	<field name="description">A mild form of maple syrup urine disease, a metabolic disorder due to an enzyme defect in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Accumulation of these 3 amino acids and their corresponding keto acids leads to encephalopathy and progressive neurodegeneration. Clinical features include mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. The keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids are present in the urine. If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms. The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder become apparent later in infancy or childhood and are typically milder, but they still involve developmental delay and other medical problems if not treated. MSUDMV is characterized by increased plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) apparent at birth. Treatment with a low-protein diet free of BCAA can result in normal psychomotor development and lack of metabolic episodes.</field>

	<field name="acronym">HH21</field>
	<field name="description">A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).</field>

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4.</field>

Aplasia cutis congenita can be located anywhere on the body, but in the vast majority of the cases, it is present on the posterior parietal region where it is often associated with an underlying defect of the parietal bones. Limb abnormalities are typically limb truncation defects affecting the distal phalanges or entire digits (true ectrodactyly). Only rarely, metatarsals/metacarpals or more proximal limb structures are also affected. Apart from transverse limb defects, syndactyly, most commonly of second and third toes, can also be observed. The clinical features are highly variable and can also include cardiovascular malformations, brain abnormalities and vascular defects such as cutis marmorata and dilated scalp veins.</field>

	<field name="description">A disease belonging to the group of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. It is characterized by the reflux of urine from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes into the kidneys, and is a risk factor for urinary tract infections. Primary disease results from a developmental defect of the ureterovesical junction. In combination with intrarenal reflux, the resulting inflammatory reaction may result in renal injury or scarring, also called reflux nephropathy. Extensive renal scarring impairs renal function and may predispose patients to hypertension, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease.</field>

Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).</field>

	<field name="description">An axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy. CMT2V is an autosomal dominant sensory neuropathy with late onset. The main clinical feature is recurrent leg pain that progresses to constant painful paraesthesias in the feet and later the hands. As it evolves, some patients develop a mild sensory ataxia.</field>

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. It is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies. Peripheral axonal neuropathies are characterized by signs of axonal regeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, and normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities.</field>

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy. CMT2X patients manifest a slowly progressive, peripheral neuropathy affecting the lower limbs and resulting in gait difficulties and distal sensory impairment. Some patients also have upper limb involvement.</field>

	<field name="description">A neuromuscular disorder. Distal hereditary motor neuronopathies constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN7A is characterized by onset in the second decade of progressive distal muscle wasting and weakness affecting the upper and lower limbs and resulting in walking difficulties and hand grip. There is significant muscle atrophy of the hands and lower limbs. The disorder is associated with vocal cord paresis due to involvement of the tenth cranial nerve.</field>

DHS erythrocytes exhibit decreased total cation and potassium content that are not accompanied by a proportional net gain of sodium and water. DHS patients typically exhibit mild to moderate compensated hemolytic anemia, with an increased erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and a decreased osmotic fragility, both of which reflect cellular dehydration. Patients may also show perinatal edema and pseudohyperkalemia due to loss of potassium from red cells stored at room temperature. A minor proportion of red cells appear as stomatocytes on blood films. Complications such as splenomegaly and cholelithiasis, resulting from increased red cell trapping in the spleen and elevated bilirubin levels, respectively, may occur. The course of DHS is frequently associated with iron overload, which may lead to hepatosiderosis.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of anterior segment dysgenesis, a group of defects affecting anterior structures of the eye including cornea, iris, lens, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm canal. Anterior segment dysgeneses result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Different anterior segment anomalies may exist alone or in combination, including iris hypoplasia, enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Clinical conditions falling within the phenotypic spectrum of anterior segment dysgeneses include aniridia, Axenfeld anomaly, Reiger anomaly/syndrome, Peters anomaly, and iridogoniodysgenesis. Some ASGD2 patients show congenital primary aphakia, a defect caused by eye development arrest around the 4th-5th week of gestation. This prevents the formation of any lens structure and leads to severe secondary ocular anomalies, including a complete aplasia of the anterior segment of the eye. In contrast, in secondary aphakic eyes, lens induction has occurred, and the lens vesicle has developed to some degree but finally has progressively resorbed perinatally, leading, therefore, to less severe ocular defects. ASGD2 inheritance is autosomal recessive.</field>

	<field name="description">An autosomal dominant form of Paget disease, a disorder of bone remodeling characterized by increased bone turnover affecting one or more sites throughout the skeleton, primarily the axial skeleton. Osteoclastic overactivity followed by compensatory osteoblastic activity leads to a structurally disorganized mosaic of bone (woven bone), which is mechanically weaker, larger, less compact, more vascular, and more susceptible to fracture than normal adult lamellar bone. PDB6 is characterized by adult onset of bone pain associated with polyostotic bone lesions primarily affecting the axial skeleton. In some cases, the pagetic tissue undergoes neoplastic transformation, resulting in osteosarcoma and, less frequently, in giant cell tumor of bone.</field>

	<field name="description">A form of uncombable hair syndrome, a condition characterized by scalp hair that is impossible to comb due to the haphazard arrangement of the hair bundles. A characteristic morphologic feature is a triangular to reniform to heart shape on cross-sections, and a groove, canal or flattening along the entire length of the hair. Most individuals are affected early in childhood and the hair takes on a spun-glass appearance with the hair becoming dry, curly, glossy, lighter in color, and progressively uncombable. The hair growth rate can range from slow to normal, and the condition improves with age.</field>
