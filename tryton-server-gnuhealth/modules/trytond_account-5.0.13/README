trytond_account
===============

The account module of the Tryton application platform.

The module generates minimal chart of accounts for many languages. The XML
files for each language are generated from the same original XML file thanks to
the localize.xsl XSLT script. The script will produce on the standard output
the desired XML file. The XSLT script can be launched with the following
command::

    xsltproc --stringparam lang <lang> localize.xsl minimal_chart.xml

where ``lang`` is one of the languages.
